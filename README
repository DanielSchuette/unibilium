This is a very basic terminfo library. It doesn't depend on curses or any other
library. It also doesn't use global variables, so it should be thread-safe.

Basic documentation is in the doc/ directory.

To use it, compile unibilium.c, uninames.c, and uniutil.c into a library.
Include "unibilium.h" in your code.
